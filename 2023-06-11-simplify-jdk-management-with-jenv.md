# Simplify JDK Management with jEnv: A Guide to Efficiently Handle Multiple JDK Versions

Are you a developer who frequently works on projects requiring different [Java Development Kits (JDKs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit)? Managing these JDK installations manually can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Fortunately, there is a solution called [jEnv](https://www.jenv.be/) that simplifies the management of multiple JDK versions. In this guide, we will explore how to use jEnv effectively to handle various JDK installations with ease, optimizing your Java development workflow.

## What is jEnv and How Does It Help?

jEnv is a powerful command-line tool specifically designed to streamline the management of multiple JDK installations. By allowing us to set the JAVA_HOME environment variable globally, locally within the current directory or within our shell, jEnv enables seamless switching between different Java versions. It's important to note that jEnv doesn't install JDKs itself; instead, it assists in managing and switching between existing JDK installations.

## Installing jEnv: Step-by-Step Instructions

To begin harnessing the benefits of jEnv, you need to install it on your system. The installation process may vary slightly depending on your operating system. Let's take a look at how to install jEnv on macOS via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```zsh
brew install jenv
```

Now that jEnv is installed we need to add the path to our shell:

```zsh
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.jenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
echo 'eval "$(jenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Note: If you're using the Bash shell, replace `~/.zshrc` with `~/.bash_profile` in the commands above.

After completing the installation, it's essential to verify that jEnv is properly installed. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```zsh
jenv doctor
```

A successful installation will yield output confirming that jEnv is correctly loaded. Please note that as this only installs jEnv and does not install Java there will some errors related to Java installation. We will have a look at how to fix this in the next section.

## Efficiently Managing JDK Versions with jEnv

Now that you have jEnv installed, let's dive into effectively managing multiple JDK versions using this powerful tool.

### Adding JDKs to jEnv

To utilize a specific JDK version with jEnv, you need to add it to the jEnv configuration. Here's an example of adding JDK 8 to jEnv on macOS using Homebrew:

1. Install the desired JDK version using Homebrew, such as JDK 8:

    ```zsh
    brew install openjdk@8
    ```

2. Create a symbolic link to the JDK installation directory:

    ```zsh
    sudo ln -sfn /usr/local/opt/openjdk@8/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-8.jdk
   ```

3. Add the JDK to jEnv by executing the following command:

   ```zsh
   jenv add /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-8.jdk/Contents/Home/
   ```

Ensure that you replace the path in the command above with the appropriate JDK installation location on your system. Repeat the same process for other JDK versions you wish to add, such as JDK 11, 17, and 20.

To verify that the JDKs have been successfully added to jEnv, use the following command:

```zsh
jenv versions
```

This command will display a list of all the JDK versions registered with jEnv, including the ones you added.

### Effective Management of JDK Versions

jEnv provides three types of JDK configuration options: global, local, and shell-specific.

**Global**: Sets the JDK version globally for the entire system. To set the global JDK version, use the following command:

```zsh
jenv global <jdk_version>
```

Replace `<jdk_version>` with the desired version, such as 1.8, 11, 17, or 20.

**Local**: Sets the JDK version for a specific directory. To set the JDK version for a specific directory, navigate to the directory in your terminal and run:

```zsh
jenv local <jdk_version>
```

This command creates a `.java-version` file in the directory with the specified version number. The JDK version will be automatically switched when working within this directory.

**Shell-Specific**: Sets the JDK version for the current shell session. To set the JDK version for the current shell session, use:

```zsh
jenv shell <jdk_version>
```

Again, replace `<jdk_version>` with the desired JDK version.

By leveraging the `jenv local` option, you can set different JDK versions for specific directories, ensuring compatibility with various projects. For instance, you can set JDK 17 as the global or system version and JDK 11 as the version used specifically for an [Apache Druid](https://druid.apache.org/) project relying on JDK 11.

### Testing jEnv Setup

After configuring jEnv, it's crucial to verify that everything is functioning correctly. Run the following command to check the jEnv setup:

```zsh
jenv doctor
```

A successful setup will display output confirming that jEnv is correctly loaded, java binaries are available, and all the checks pass without any errors.

### Enhancing Functionality with Plugins

jEnv supports plugins that integrate seamlessly with popular build tools like [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). Enabling these plugins enhances the integration between jEnv and the respective build tools, further simplifying JDK version management within the build process.

To enable a plugin, execute the following command:

```zsh
jenv enable-plugin <plugin_name>
```

For example, to enable the Maven plugin, use:

```zsh
jenv enable-plugin maven
```

Similarly, to enable the Gradle plugin, execute:

```zsh
jenv enable-plugin gradle
```

With these plugins enabled, you can enjoy a more streamlined and efficient development experience, making it easier to work with different JDK versions in your projects.

## Conclusion: Simplify Your JDK Management with jEnv

By leveraging jEnv, the management of multiple JDK installations becomes hassle-free and highly efficient. Switching between different Java versions, whether globally, locally, or within specific shell sessions, is now a breeze. Furthermore, with the added benefit of enabling plugins, such as Maven and Gradle integration, jEnv significantly simplifies JDK version management within your build process.
